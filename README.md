ARCHITECTURE

Used Express HTML, Javascript, and SPA
Express is minimal and flexible, is fast and highly efficient, has middleware framework for various functionality
such as authentication and error handling, Express has routing capability for requests like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.

Javascript is a dynamic, lightweight programming language that can manipulate HTML and CSS dynamically with
its client-side scripting. Also has server-side capabilities where Javascript can run on servers.

SPA is single-page application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates content as the user
interacts with the app without requiring page reloads.

MongoDB is flexible, scalable, and easy to modify so the backend used NoSQL MongoDB database.



FUNCTIONALITY

JSON and Javascript are related but JSON is lightwieght and has a data-interchange fromat that is used
to transfer data between systems. Javascript is a programming language used to create dynamic and interactive
web applications. JSON ties together frontends and backend development because the frontend uses Javascript to hold
JSON data such as trip name and description. The application was refactored from a static HTML to use the efficient
database.



TESTING

Testing was the use of console log messages and running Postman and asking for help.
I ran into a lot of errors midway through the project and didn't address them so the bugs piled up.



REFLECTION

This course has taught me that many problems will occur and I should solve them as soon as possible.
In this course I explored Express, Angular, JSON, Javascript, etc and became familiar with new things
that I was not previously used to. To become more marketable I will have to keep exploring programming.
